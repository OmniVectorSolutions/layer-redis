description: |
  Redis is a key-value database in a similar vein to memcache but the
  dataset is non-volatile. Redis additionally provides native support
  for atomically manipulating and querying data structures such as lists
  and sets.  The dataset is stored entirely in memory and periodically
  flushed to disk.
